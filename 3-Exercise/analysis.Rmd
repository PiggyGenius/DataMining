# Data mining: $3^{rd}$ practical

### Document classification

#### 1. What is the dimension of the problem (the size of the vocabulary)? What is the number of documents per class (their distribution)?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
all_data = readLines("BaseReuters-29")
```

#### 2. Split randomly the collection into a training set (52500 documents) and a test set (18203 documents).

#### 3. Estimate the parameters of the Bernoulli and the Multinomial models using the training set (following the maximum likelihood approach) and the Laplace smoothing.

#### 4. Estimate the accuracy of both models on the test set.
				     
#### 5. Repeat the steps 2 to 4, 20 times. Estimate the average of the accuracies obtained on the 20 randomly chosen test sets as well as it standard deviation.
